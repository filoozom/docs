### Welcome to the Helium Network

The Helium Network is the largest LoRaWAN Network in the North America, and enables long range, low power, bi-directional communication for any LoRaWAN compatible device. 

##  Blockchain

The Helium Blockchain is a public blockchain created to underpin the growth of decentralized, verifiable wireless networks. It uses a new, novel proof, called Proof of Coverage, to incentivize miners to create wireless coverage. The Helium Blockchain also creates $HNT, a new utility token used to reward miners and pay transaction fees. 

## Miners

Miners on the Helium Network serve a dual purpose: they create long-range wireless coverage for devices and sensors using the Network; and they are responsible for mining and verifying network transactions. As of October 2020, the Helium Network is approaching 10,000 miners, making it the 2nd largest, fully-decentralized blockchain in the world, behind only the bitcoin blockchain. 

## Devices

The Helium Network exists to route data for wireless, LoRaWAN-enabled, IoT devices. Whether you're building a weather station from scratch or have a pre-built location tracker from a vendor of your choosing, your device can use the Helium Network to send and receive data anywhere there is coverage.

## Console

Devices on the Helium Network are deployed and managed through Console, Helium's free, hosted interface for onboarding andsimplifying your
